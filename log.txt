# Image_Recognition_v1
.LOG

7:32 PM 27-Nov-17
This is my log file to report the things I do in my Image Recognition Project.This is nothing but a "Hello World" Program in the Machine Learning World.
I'm creating v1 using only a simple "Logistic Regression and One vs All Classification".I'm expecting accuracy of ~90% or less.

The code name of this project is "IMGRG".

Details are as follows;
{File Names}
[Final_Program.py]- A python 3.6 program to just gather the pixels of the Grayscale Images and convert them to pixels and store them in [IMGRG_data.txt].
[IMGRG_data.txt]- A text file created by the [Final_Program.py]. It stores the values of pixels of various Images in a comma seperatef form.
[IMGRG_testdata.txt]- A text file creted by [Testing_Data_Creator.py].It stores the values of pixels of various Images in a comma seperated form.
[Testing_Data_Creator]- A python 3.6 program to just gather the pixels of the Grayscale Images and convert them to pixels and store them in [IMGRG_testdata.txt]. 
[Main_matlab_Program.m]- A MATLAB file to implement all the other MATLAB functions and finally performing the real work.



{Folder}
[Training_Set]- This folder contains another five folders which contain 1000 images for each digit from 1-5.
[Testing data]- This folder contains another five folders which contain 1000 images for each digit from 1-5.

{Update}:
Just ran the modelon the existing digits and it was 98.72% accurate for 100 iterations and 97.64% for 50 iterations. (lamda =0.1)
But the main point is that it tested the training data, now its time to make it test for new data.
For this I'll use another set of 5000 images(1000 of each type) and check whether the model was accurate or not.

{Update}:
Just ran the model on the test dataset and it was 97.64% accurate for 50 iterations.(lamda =0.1) 
Mind you, the testing data is not as same as the training and still the model was accurate enough.
